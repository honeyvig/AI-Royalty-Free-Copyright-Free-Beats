# AI-Royalty-Free-Copyright-Free-Beats
create an artificial intelligence system capable of generating royalty-free, copyright-free beats, with a focus on trap music. The ideal candidate will have experience in music generation algorithms and a strong understanding of the nuances of trap music. All generated outputs must be fully owned by us, ensuring complete rights are granted. This project is perfect for someone passionate about music technology and looking to make an impact in the music production community.
-----
To create an AI system that generates royalty-free, copyright-free beats, particularly focused on trap music, we need to design a model that can generate music based on the specific characteristics of trap music (e.g., 808 bass, snare, hi-hats, melody). For this, we can use a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), or more modern methods like Transformers or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In this case, we can use an RNN-based model like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Units) to generate beats, or use pre-built frameworks like Magenta (by Google) to accelerate the music generation process.
Approach:

    Dataset: First, we need a dataset of trap music beats (such as MIDI files). These MIDI files will be used to train the model.
    Preprocessing: Convert the MIDI files into a format suitable for training (such as time-series sequences for beats).
    Model Architecture: Weâ€™ll use an LSTM-based model for generating the music, as LSTMs are effective at handling time-series data like music.
    Music Generation: After training, the model will be able to generate sequences of notes that can be converted back to MIDI files to produce beats.
    Post-Processing: Convert the generated music back into an audio file (e.g., .wav format).

Dependencies:

    TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (for model building)
    Magenta (for MIDI generation)
    Mido or PrettyMIDI (for MIDI manipulation)
    FluidSynth or pyfluidsynth (for converting MIDI to audio)

Steps:

    Preprocessing MIDI Files: Load and preprocess the MIDI files.
    Model Definition: Define a neural network that can generate beats in the style of trap music.
    Train the Model: Train the model on a dataset of trap beats.
    Generate Music: Use the trained model to generate new beats.
    Post-Process and Convert MIDI to Audio: Convert the generated MIDI files into audio files.

Here is an example Python code that outlines these steps.
1. Preprocessing MIDI Files:

We'll first need to load and preprocess the MIDI files into a format that can be used to train the AI model.

import os
import mido
import numpy as np
from mido import MidiFile

def preprocess_midi_files(midi_directory):
    midi_sequences = []
    
    for file_name in os.listdir(midi_directory):
        if file_name.endswith('.mid'):
            midi_file = MidiFile(os.path.join(midi_directory, file_name))
            midi_sequence = []
            
            for track in midi_file.tracks:
                for msg in track:
                    if msg.type == 'note_on' or msg.type == 'note_off':
                        midi_sequence.append(msg.note)
            
            midi_sequences.append(midi_sequence)
    
    return midi_sequences

# Example usage
midi_directory = 'path_to_midi_files'
midi_sequences = preprocess_midi_files(midi_directory)

2. Model Definition (LSTM-based):

Next, we define an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras to generate beats.

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_lstm_model(input_shape):
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.LSTM(128, input_shape=input_shape, return_sequences=True))
    model.add(layers.LSTM(128))
    model.add(layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(88, activation='softmax'))  # 88 notes for piano range (MIDI notes)

    model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Input shape based on preprocessed MIDI data
input_shape = (None, 1)  # Time series data, adjust as needed
model = create_lstm_model(input_shape)

3. Training the Model:

To train the model, we need to prepare the sequences of MIDI notes for training. Each note will be encoded, and the model will be trained to predict the next note in the sequence.

def prepare_sequences(midi_sequences, seq_length=100):
    input_sequences = []
    target_notes = []

    for sequence in midi_sequences:
        for i in range(len(sequence) - seq_length):
            input_seq = sequence[i:i + seq_length]
            target_note = sequence[i + seq_length]
            input_sequences.append(input_seq)
            target_notes.append(target_note)

    # Convert to numpy arrays
    X = np.array(input_sequences)
    y = np.array(target_notes)
    y = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y, num_classes=88)  # For MIDI notes range 0-88
    return X, y

X, y = prepare_sequences(midi_sequences)

# Train the model
model.fit(X, y, batch_size=64, epochs=50)

4. Generate Music:

Once the model is trained, we can use it to generate new beats. The model will generate one note at a time, and the generated notes will be converted into a MIDI file.

def generate_music(model, seed_sequence, length=500):
    generated_notes = []
    current_sequence = seed_sequence

    for _ in range(length):
        prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(current_sequence, axis=0))
        next_note = np.argmax(prediction, axis=1)[0]
        generated_notes.append(next_note)
        current_sequence = np.append(current_sequence[1:], next_note)

    return generated_notes

# Example usage
seed_sequence = np.random.randint(0, 88, 100)  # Random seed for generating music
generated_notes = generate_music(model, seed_sequence)

# Convert generated notes to MIDI
def notes_to_midi(generated_notes, output_path='generated_beat.mid'):
    mid = mido.MidiFile()
    track = mido.MidiTrack()
    mid.tracks.append(track)
    
    for note in generated_notes:
        track.append(mido.Message('note_on', note=note, velocity=64, time=500))
        track.append(mido.Message('note_off', note=note, velocity=64, time=500))
    
    mid.save(output_path)

notes_to_midi(generated_notes)

5. Convert MIDI to Audio:

Now, we will convert the generated MIDI file into an audio file (e.g., .wav).

import pyfluidsynth

def midi_to_audio(midi_path, audio_path='generated_beat.wav'):
    fs = pyfluidsynth.Synth()
    fs.sfload("path_to_soundfont.sf2")  # Load a SoundFont (for example, a trap soundfont)
    fs.midi_to_audio(midi_path, audio_path)

midi_to_audio('generated_beat.mid')

Summary of the Process:

    Preprocessing: MIDI files are loaded, and sequences of notes are extracted.
    Model: An LSTM-based model is created to generate MIDI notes.
    Training: The model is trained on sequences of MIDI data.
    Generation: The model generates new MIDI notes, which are then saved into a MIDI file.
    Conversion: The MIDI file is converted into an audio file using a SoundFont.

Notes:

    The quality of the generated music depends on the dataset, the model's complexity, and the training process. Trap music has unique features, so the dataset should be large and specific to trap music to get good results.
    Fine-tuning the model, experimenting with different architectures (e.g., GANs for music generation), and using specialized soundfonts are important to enhance the quality of the generated beats.
    The AI will generate royalty-free beats, and you have full control over the generated music as per the ownership requirements.

This is a simplified version, and you can extend it further by integrating additional functionalities like real-time generation, adding variations to the beats, or integrating with platforms like Ableton or FL Studio for further customization.
